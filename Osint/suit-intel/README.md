## Problem Statement

Tony found that some 'n00b_h4ck0r' logged into his system last night remotely. Our intel team is searching for this noob hackor. They're sure that he is active on social media. Help the intel team by finding his location.

Answer format: Find the latitude and longitude trimmed to  2 decimal places along with the direction.
eg. if location is 123.5609 N, 65.859 W then answer is 123.56N,65.85W

## Solution

'n00b_h4ck0r' looks like some user name. Searching for the username on the popular social media platforms we find a [twitter account](https://twitter.com/n00b_h4ck0r). In the location field we find Houston. Upon searching for the location coordinates of houston we get answer.
