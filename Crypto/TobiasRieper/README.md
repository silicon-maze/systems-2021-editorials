Intercepted Message : `]]2D2D572D582D582D5582D5]]]|p+tLHb==05_?b028b?EN]]25D82D82D572D57]]]]]`

## Hint

Try figuring out how the title can be connected to the cipher

## Solution

The title suggests that it's Agent47 aka Hitman. 47 -> ROT47. The message is encrypted with ROT47. Use any ROT47 decrypter to decrypt the message to acquire the flag.
