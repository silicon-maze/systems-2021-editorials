Answer / Flag: `MAZE{CORRECT}`


## Problem Statement
The romans had a complex method of encrypting messages. First it had to be given to the Caesar who used his private key on it and then it was mixed with a special form 
of vinegar known as QUURYMU to finally decrypt it. If the initial cipher message was VLOLFRQ, what was the final decrypted message ?

## Solution
First you decode with caesar cipher. The only sensible word you can get is SILICON (understandable since competition name is silicon maze). It's also the standard +3 shift 
version. Then you need to decode with the vigenere cipher with the key given as QUURYMU. You will get answer as CORRECT.
